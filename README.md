## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.
I feel that a fair grade would be a 14/20 as I was able to get the majority of the program and tests to work, however I was just not able to get the userSelection or the cpuSelection to properly pass to the gameHistoryLog as it displays an HTML error and undefined. 
## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
I encountered many struggeles learning the JS doms as this is a much different process than I have seen in other languages. I used the help of the internet and classmates. 

### How long it took us to finish this?
This lab took me around 10 hours.
